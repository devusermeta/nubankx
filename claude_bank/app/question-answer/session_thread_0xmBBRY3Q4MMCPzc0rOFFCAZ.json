      "question": "how can I get debt free in 3 weeks?",
      "answer": "Based on the book, there is no specific guidance for becoming debt-free within 3 weeks. Strategies generally involve budgeting, prioritizing debt repayment (like the snowball or avalanche method), and cutting expenses. Would you like me to create a support ticket so a financial advisor can help with a tailored plan?",

      "question": "what is avalanche method",
      "answer": "Based on the book \"Debt-Free to Financial Freedom,\" the avalanche method involves paying off your debts in order of the highest interest rate to the lowest. Make minimum payments on all debts, then allocate any extra funds to the one with the highest interest first. This saves money on interest in the long run. (Source: Chapter 2)",
